## Python Integration with Flask

### Goal:
<h4>Build a RESTful API for ABC University admissions using Flask and MySQL,</h4> 
<h4>with OpenAPI documentation and Swagger.  Weâ€™ll then run our Flask application</h4> 
<h4>and test its functionality.</h4>

### API (Application Programming Interface)
<h4>Is a set of rules and protocols that allows</h4> 
<h4>different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs enable programs</h4> 
<h4>to request and exchange data or functionality, making it easier to build systems that work together.</h4>

### Concepts:
<h4>REST API basics, MySQL as a backend, OpenAPI/Swagger for documentation and testing.</h4>

#### Flask:
<h4>Flask is a lightweight, flexible web framework for Python that makes it easy to build web applications and APIs. It is known for its simplicity and allows developers to quickly set up and customize web projects.</h4>
#### Flask-RESTx 
<h4>Is an extension for Flask that simplifies building RESTful APIs. It provides helpful tools for structuring your API, validating input, and automatically generating interactive documentation (using OpenAPI/Swagger) for your endpoints.</h4>
#### RESTful API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) 
<h4>A way for software applications to communicate over the web using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. RESTful APIs organize and access resources (such as data or services) in a simple, consistent, and stateless manner, making it easy for different systems to interact and exchange information.<h4/>
#### OpenAPI 
<h4>A standard specification for describing the structure and behavior of RESTful APIs in a machine-readable format. It allows developers to document, visualize, and test APIs easily, and tools like Swagger UI can generate interactive documentation directly from an OpenAPI definition.</h4>
#### Swagger docs 
<h4>Are automatically generated, interactive documentation for RESTful APIs, based on the OpenAPI specification. They provide a user-friendly web interface where developers can read about each API endpoint, see the required input and output formats, and even test API calls directly from the browser. This helps make APIs easier to understand, use, and debug.</h4>
